# MicroInterations

This repository offers different micro-interactions that will help get you rocking and rolling on your next project.

They have been implemented as different Angular components, but they are mainly designed with HTML and CSS, so it would be easy to use them in every other environment.

*IMPORTANT:* Every micro-interaction has its own component, with its own HTML and CSS.
